I  rights on this project. I made this project to learn python, and all the rights to the respective creator.
I made this project by watching a youtube video (link: https://youtu.be/th4OBktqK1I?si=1mCNDatNSpbEnYQP)

About Project:
1. The user will deposite a certain amount of money.
2. Allow them to bet on either one, two or three lines of the slot machine (just to keep it pretty simple).
3. And then determine if they won.
4. If they got any lines, we're ganna multiply their bet by the value of the line, add that to their balance and then allow them to keep playing until they wanna cash out or until they run out of money.

---

1. We need to collect the user deposite.
2. We need to add that to their balance.
3. We need to allow them to bet on a line or on multiple lines.
4. We need to see if they got any of those lines.
5. We then need to spin the slot machine or we would have done that before.
6. We need to generate different items that are going to be in the slot machine on the different reels.
7. We need to add whatever they won back to their balance.
